                Angela Current is a health care professional turned wanna-be nerd coder. She currently has a masters degree in Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine which she obtained in 2016.
                Graduating with honors, Angela understands what it takes to succeed at a new task, and she is willing to put in the time to understand all the languages that coders use to make, as well as style various websites and applications. 
                Angela admits that graduating with honors isn't helping her much, but persist she must!
                Angela is a very hard and dedicated worker, but can get frusterated and easily overwhelmed. To get through those moments, she turns to exercise to relieve stress. 
                One of Angelas favorite ways to exercise is by hanging out with her dog. They enjoy going on short runs together.
